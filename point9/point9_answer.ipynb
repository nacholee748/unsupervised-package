    "#Point 9:\n",
    "\n",
    "UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique that uses a combination of mathematical principles from nerve theorem, graph theory, Riemannian geometry, and topological data analysis to construct a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "UMAP preserves the topological structure of an original set, and drastically reduces the times and processing times of T-SNE processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has an advantage that it doesn't need to be reset every time new points are added to the pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The nerve theorem is used to construct a simplicial complex that captures the topological structure of the data. UMAP constructs a weighted k-nearest neighbor graph, where each data point is connected to its k nearest neighbors, and uses the weights on these edges to represent the degree of similarity between the connected points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Riemannian geometry is used to measure the distance between points in the low-dimensional space by minimizing a cost function based on a Riemannian metriz, which measures the curvature of a space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a branch of mathematics that uses algebraic topological structure of data. In the context of UMAP, TDA is used to construct a simplicial complex using the Mapper algorithm, which constructs a simplicial complex based on a cover of overlapping sets."
